## Features

- Choice between automatically run at a time of day or having a solve button in the game page.
- If auto mode is set and you go to the LinkedIn Queens game page before the set time, it will **still automatically solve it**
- Auto Mode will automatically open a new LinkedIn Queens game page at that time, but it will not close it after it is solved.
- Because the solver runs too fast, if you set it to solve after 0 seconds most of the time it won't give you a time. If you want to automatically solve after 5 seconds, LinkedIn will give you a time.
- Settings are saved via Google Account Sync.

## Installation

I have not paid the $5 to register my account to put this on the Chrome Web Store.

1. Clone the Github
   - Easiest way is to go in a terminal and run "git clone https://github.com/tzwukerf/linkedin-queens-project.git", although it's your choice how you choose to clone it.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Press the "Load Unpacked" Button

5. Make your way to your git directory. The folder should be called "linkedin-queens-project", and you should see the .git file in it (do not click on it). Once you are in this folder, press "Select Folder"

This is how you know you have the extension:
